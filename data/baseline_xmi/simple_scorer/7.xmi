Ownership of large tracts of land continued for a long time in this region and it lagged behind in terms of the emancipation of the peasant farmers, so the peasant movement demanding emancipation developed into a major force. In the 19th century, emancipation of the peasants took place in this region as well, but their economic situation did not necessarily improve.Land reforms were carried out in Russia after the October Revolution and in Eastern Europe after the Second World War , and new approaches to agriculture were pursued under socialism.Under this system, farmers were required to cooperate and collectivize in various ways. &#10;&#10;Question 4: From (1)-(4) below, choose the sentence in which the word with a wavy line below it is correct in regard to peasant farmers in Central and Eastern Europe, in relation to the underlined portion (4) . &#10;&#10;    (1) In Austria, efforts were made to emancipate peasants under Frederick the Great . &#10;    (2) The emancipation of peasants in Prussia was carried out amid the Thirty Years' War . &#10;    (3) In Poland and Lithuania , which united to form a kingdom in the 14th century, farmers were increasingly bound to the land. &#10;    (4) Gustavus Adolphus , who opposed the Partitions of Poland, declared the emancipation of the peasants. &#10;&#10;Question 5: In regard to the underlined portion (5) , from (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that incorrectly describes peasant farmers and agriculture in Russia. &#10;&#10;    (1) In 17th century Russia, the Peasants' Rebellion took place under the leadership of Müntzer. &#10;    (2) After Pugachev's Rebellion, serfdom was reinforced. &#10;    (3) The emancipation of the serfs took place in Russia, which had been defeated in the Crimean War. &#10;    (4) After the revolution of 1905, agricultural reforms were carried out during the reign of Nicholas II. &#10;&#10;Question 6: From (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that is correct in regard to the underlined portion (6) . &#10;&#10;    (1) The Polish Corridor was created. &#10;    (2) Albania was made a protectorate of Italy. &#10;    (3) Rijeka (Fiume) in Yugoslavia was annexed by Italy. &#10;    (4) Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform (the Communist Party Information Bureau). &#10;&#10;[Context]&#10;Southeast Asia is located in a tropical and subtropical monsoon belt, and rice cultivation has been carried out there since ancient times.Moreover, this region produced spices, so, seeking these, European powers began to enter into trade in this region by force in the early 16th century. However, when major changes in the situation surrounding trade in Asia occurred, such as a slump in the price of spices, farmers began to be forced to cultivate specific commercial crops. Colonial rule , involving the management of land and manpower in order to expand production of commercial crops, gained momentum in the 19th century.Society was transformed substantially, with the focus of agricultural production in Southeast Asia shifting from growing food for subsistence purposes to producing commercial crops for markets around the world .Due to the oppression they suffered in their daily lives, peasant rebellions occurred in various regions, and these foreshadowed the subsequent nationalist movements. &#10;&#10;Question 7: In regard to the underlined portion (7) , from (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that correctly describes Southeast Asia during the 16th and 17th centuries. &#10;&#10;    (1) The Netherlands was the first of the countries of Europe to advance into Southeast Asia. &#10;    (2) France was pushed out of the Maluku (Molucca) Islands as a result of the Amboyna massacre. &#10;    (3) The UK occupied Malacca. &#10;    (4) Spain used Manila as its base for trade in Asia. &#10;&#10;Question 8: In regard to the underlined portion (8) , from (1)-(4) below, choose the sentence in which the word with a wavy line below it is correct in regard to colonial rule by the Great Powers in Southeast Asia. &#10;&#10;    (1) Portugal earned enormous profits as a result of its forced cultivation system in Java. &#10;    (2) Thai land was the only country in Southeast Asia to be spared colonial rule and retain its independence. &#10;    (3) The rebellion of the Black Flag Army, which opposed British colonial rule, took place in Vietnam. &#10;    (4) France's Straits Settlements and the realm of the Dutch East Indies were established after the Napoleonic Wars. &#10;&#10;Question 9: In regard to the underlined portion (9) , from (1)-(4) below, choose the one option that was not a major commercial crop for export produced in Java. &#10;&#10;    (1) Coffee &#10;    (2) Rice &#10;    (3) Indigo &#10;    (4) Sugarcane &#10;&#10;"/><types:SetInstruction xmi:id="1" sofa="7" begin="22" end="347" text="Agriculture is mankind's most basic form of occupation and the conditions faced by farmers are an indicator that helps us to understand a particular era or society.
