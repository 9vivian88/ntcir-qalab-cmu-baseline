In Athens, where democracy began to develop in around the 5th century BCE, people called Sophists had a major impact on the education of citizens involved in the politics of the city .They had a strong tendency to advocate the subjectivity of morals.On the other hand, there was also burgeoning activity on the part of philosophers who advocated that citizens live according to universal truths and morals.Subsequently, after the cities of Greece lost their political autonomy due to the growing power of Macedonia , conspicuous activity emerged on the part of those who sought to advocate standards of conduct as citizens of the world, rather than citizens of a city-state, as well as preaching the peace of mind of individuals.Some of these ideas were absorbed by the society of Rome, which was developing from a city-state into a global empire, and was popularized as Stoicism . &#10;&#10;Question 1: In regard to the underlined portion (1) , from (1)-(4) below, choose the most appropriate sentence that describes the people called Sophists, who were active during the 5th century BCE. &#10;&#10;    (1) Socrates, who was their number, asserted that &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;, and denied the existence of objective truths. &#10;    (2) Their main activity involved exploring the origins of all things. &#10;    (3) They taught rhetoric to the citizens. &#10;    (4) They strove to establish orthodox doctrine as Church fathers. &#10;&#10;Question 2: From (1)-(4) below, choose the correct name of the battle in which Macedonia defeated the allied forces of Athens and Thebes during the 4th century BCE, leading to its rule over Greece, in relation to the underlined portion (2) . &#10;&#10;    (1) The Battle of Actium &#10;    (2) The Battle of Chaeronea &#10;    (3) The Battle of Salamis &#10;    (4) The Battle of Marathon &#10;&#10;Question 3: From (1)-(4) below, choose the one correct sentence concerning a work that demonstrates the ideas referred to in the underlined portion (3) . &#10;&#10;    (1) Works and Days was written by Virgil. &#10;    (2) Ab urbe condita libri (History of Rome) was written by Cicero. &#10;    (3) Meditations was written by Emperor Marcus Aurelius. &#10;    (4) Confessions was written by Emperor Diocletian. &#10;&#10;[Context]&#10;In China, importance was attached to Confucianism in the Imperial examinations that began to be conducted in the Sui period, and Emperor Taizong of Tang ordered  _____ et al. to compile the Wujing zhengyi (Correct Meaning of the Five Classics), which was a commentary on the Five Classics.As the Imperial examinations became firmly established from the Tang to the Song periods, people who had become government officials through the Imperial examinations formed a ruling class in society and came to support Confucianist governance .Being selected as a government official meant that not only the individual concerned, but also his entire family enjoyed various privileges, so success or failure in the examinations directly affected their prosperity or decline.The Imperial examinations were exceedingly competitive, so people increasingly put a great deal of effort into education and studying for the examinations, striving to ensure that a succession of family members passed them.In the Imperial examinations, candidates were not only asked about their knowledge of Confucianism; importance was also attached to skills in composing poetry and prose, so government officials and candidates for such posts became important cultural leaders . &#10;&#10;Question 4: From (1)-(4) below, choose the correct person's name that should be inserted into the gap marked (4) in the text. &#10;&#10;    (1) Bai Juyi &#10;    (2) Wu Daozi &#10;    (3) Ban Gu &#10;    (4) Kong Yingda &#10;&#10;Question 5: In regard to the underlined portion (5) , from (1)-(4) below, choose the correct combination of words that fit into the gaps marked (A) and (B) in the sentences below concerning the governance and education of the common people during the Ming period. &#10;&#10;[Question Data] &#10;In order to rule the common people, the Hongwu Emperor, also known as the Great Ancestor of the Ming, implemented the  _____ system, which was a system for the administration of villages, and he also set forth the  _____ , which stipulated &quot;Be filial and obedient to your parents.
