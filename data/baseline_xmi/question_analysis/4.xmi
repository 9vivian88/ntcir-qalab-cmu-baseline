Germany and Italy lagged behind in this process; the former saw the rise of Hitler, who dreamed of the Third Reich ruling Europe, while in the latter emerged Mussolini, who called for the building of an empire to rule the Mediterranean. &#10;&#10;Question 1: From (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that is correct in regard to the empire referred to in the underlined portion (1) . &#10;&#10;    (1) The heyday of this empire was during the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. &#10;    (2) During the 14th century, this empire waged the Hundred Years' War against France. &#10;    (3) Napoleon revived this empire. &#10;    (4) Emperor Henry IV of this empire came into conflict with the Pope. &#10;&#10;Question 2: From (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that is correct in regard to the underlined portion (2) . &#10;&#10;    (1) Bismarck was defeated by Austria in the Austro-Prussian War and abandoned the incorporation of Austria into a unified Germany. &#10;    (2) Bismarck defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War. &#10;    (3) The German Emperor Wilhelm I came into conflict with Bismarck after his coronation and he caused Bismarck to resign. &#10;    (4) The German Empire formed the Triple Alliance with Austria and France. &#10;&#10;Question 3: From (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that is correct in regard to the underlined portion (3) . &#10;&#10;    (1) France expanded into China and leased Kiautschou Bay. &#10;    (2) Germany deployed a global strategy by means of the so-called &quot;3C policy&quot;. &#10;    (3) Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom became Empress of India. &#10;    (4) The Netherlands colonized Liberia in the early 20th century. &#10;&#10;Question 4: From (1)-(4) below, choose the one sentence that is correct in regard to the underlined portion (4) . &#10;&#10;    (1) Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and annexed it. &#10;    (2) Along with Hitler, Mussolini created the Munich-Rome Axis. &#10;    (3) Hitler annexed Poland's Sudetenland. &#10;    (4) The Vichy regime fled to the UK and opposed Hitler. &#10;&#10;[Context]&#10;There were many ethnic groups in the extensive Ottoman Empire, but religion constituted the main sense of belonging for the people of the empire and for a long time there were few problems arising from differences between ethnic groups. However, in the 19th century, wars began to break out over independence for ethnic groups and, due in part to intervention of the countries of Europe, the breakup and dismantling of the empire progressed.Thus, the Ottoman Empire was forced to accept the contraction of its territory and it fell after the First World War.
