Prerequisites
======================

## JDK
1. Visit the [Java SE Downloads page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), and download the most recent, platform-appropriate binary for JDK 6.
2. Install the JDK from the downloaded executable file.  Note: If you are working in Windows, you will need to set the PATH environment variable manually.

## git
1. Visit the [git page](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the most recent installer.
2. Run the installer.
3. If you've never used git before, the [Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book) is an excellent guide.  However, for the impatient, we recommend this [section on setup](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) and any git quickstart guide ([this one](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/QuickStart) is OK).

## Maven
1.  Download the most recent stable version of Maven from the [Apache Maven project page](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).
2.  Run the installer.  Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of the project page.

**Note:** We use a standalone install of Maven because the Eclipse plugin version often runs into annoying build bugs.  Pointing the plugin to a standalone installation has proven to be _much_ more reliable.

## Eclipse + plugins (optional)
1. Download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (Indigo or newer) from the [Eclipse Download page](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  (Really, any version that has the Maven plugin already installed)
2. Install Eclipse by extracting the downloaded package into a directory of your choosing.
3. See the [tips page](EclipseTips) for instructions on installing plugins.

## UIMA SDK (optional)
Follow the instructions under "Install UIMA SDK" at the [Apache UIMA page](http://uima.apache.org/doc-uima-examples.html).  See the [Eclipse tips](EclipseTips) page for instructions on installing the UIMA plugins.
